a. When setting a light to be a directional light or spotlight, the actual light orb is meaningless and the direction is set with 3 floats in the light options

b. I assume the model files and the shader files exist and are valid .obj files.

c. I completed phong lighting, phong shading, and blinn shading as well as creating a plane underneath the model
   I also created options for selecting various light and scene settings

d. I did not complete the texture loading, texture display, or projection options because I ran out of time.

e. My shaders along with all my source and header files are located in the folder /CS300.
   Models must be placed in the /CS300/models folder.
