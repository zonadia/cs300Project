a. To change the model that loads, change the define MODEL_NAME defined in main.cpp.

b. I assume the model file exists and is a valid .obj file.

c. I completed the scene setup, with the exception of the orbit of the spheres being displayed with a line
   I load the model from an obj file and calculate vertex normals if the obj file only has 3 index face records
   I do all the geometry operations except having a menu driven functionality and displaying normals.

d. I have not implemented the display of line segments or have a menu driven functionality because I ran out of time, but
   I'll have them implemented along with the next assignment.

e. My shaders along with all my source and header files are located in the folder /CS300.
   Models must be placed in the /CS300/models folder.

f. One of the computers in the ZZ section of Edison.

g. I started working on it October 1st, finished it October 12th, and spent about 30 hours on it, mostly
   spent trying to get DirectX initialized correctly, getting anything at all to appear on screen,
   and dealing with issues getting data uploaded correctly to the shaders.

h. None
